 |  addAttr(self, attr, **kwargs)
 |      This command is used to add a dynamic attribute to a node or nodes. Either the
 |      longName or the shortName or both must be specified. If neither a dataType nor
 |      an attributeType is specified, a double attribute will be added.  The dataType
 |      flag can be specified more than once indicating that any of the supplied types
 |      will be accepted (logical-or).  To add a non-double attribute the following
 |      criteria can be used to determine whether the dataType or the attributeType flag
 |      is appropriate.  Some types, such as double3can use either. In these cases the
 |      -dtflag should be used when you only wish to access the data as an atomic entity
 |      (eg. you never want to access the three individual values that make up a
 |      double3).  In general it is best to use the -atin these cases for maximum
 |      flexibility. In most cases the -dtversion will not display in the attribute
 |      editor as it is an atomic type and you are not allowed to change individual
 |      parts of it.  All attributes flagged as (compound)below or the compound
 |      attribute itself are not actually added to the node until all of the children
 |      are defined (using the -pflag to set their parent to the compound being
 |      created).  See the EXAMPLES section for more details.  Type of attribute

 |      
 |      Flags:
 |      - attributeType : at             (unicode)       [create,query]
 |          Specifies the attribute type, see above table for more details. Note that the
 |          attribute types float, matrixand stringare also MEL keywords and must be
 |          enclosed in quotes.
 |      
 |      - binaryTag : bt                 (unicode)       [create,query]
 |          This flag is obsolete and does not do anything any more
 |      
 |      - cachedInternally : ci          (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Whether or not attribute data is cached internally in the node. This flag
 |          defaults to true for writable attributes and false for non-writable attributes.
 |          A warning will be issued if users attempt to force a writable attribute to be
 |          uncached as this will make it impossible to set keyframes.
 |      
 |      - category : ct                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
 |          An attribute category is a string associated with the attribute to identify it.
 |          (e.g. the name of a plugin that created the attribute, version information,
 |          etc.) Any attribute can be associated with an arbitrary number of categories
 |          however categories can not be removed once associated.
 |      
 |      - dataType : dt                  (unicode)       [create,query]
 |          Specifies the data type.  See setAttrfor more information on data type names.
 |      
 |      - defaultValue : dv              (float)         [create,query,edit]
 |          Specifies the default value for the attribute (can only be used for numeric
 |          attributes).
 |      
 |      - disconnectBehaviour : dcb      (int)           [create,query]
 |          defines the Disconnect Behaviour 2 Nothing, 1 Reset, 0 Delete
 |      
 |      - enumName : en                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
 |          Flag used to specify the ui names corresponding to the enum values. The
 |          specified string should contain a colon-separated list of the names, with
 |          optional values. If values are not specified, they will treated as sequential
 |          integers starting with 0. For example: -enumName A:B:Cwould produce options:
 |          A,B,C with values of 0,1,2; -enumName zero:one:two:thousand=1000would produce
 |          four options with values 0,1,2,1000; and -enumName
 |          solo=1:triplet=3:quintet=5would produce three options with values 1,3,5.  (Note
 |          that there is a current limitation of the Channel Box that will sometimes
 |          incorrectly display an enumerated attribute's pull-down menu.  Extra menu items
 |          can appear that represent the numbers inbetween non-sequential option values.
 |          To avoid this limitation, specify sequential values for the options of any
 |          enumerated attributes that will appear in the Channel Box.  For example:
 |          solo=1:triplet=2:quintet=3.)
 |      
 |      - exists : ex                    (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Returns true if the attribute queried is a user-added, dynamic attribute; false
 |          if not.
 |      
 |      - fromPlugin : fp                (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Was the attribute originally created by a plugin? Normally set automatically
 |          when the API call is made - only added here to support storing it in a file
 |          independently from the creating plugin.
 |      
 |      - hasMaxValue : hxv              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
 |          Flag indicating whether an attribute has a maximum value. (can only be used for
 |          numeric attributes).
 |      
 |      - hasMinValue : hnv              (bool)          [create,query,edit]
 |          Flag indicating whether an attribute has a minimum value. (can only be used for
 |          numeric attributes).
 |      
 |      - hasSoftMaxValue : hsx          (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Flag indicating whether a numeric attribute has a soft maximum.
 |      
 |      - hasSoftMinValue : hsn          (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Flag indicating whether a numeric attribute has a soft minimum.
 |      
 |      - hidden : h                     (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Will this attribute be hidden from the UI?
 |      
 |      - indexMatters : im              (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Sets whether an index must be used when connecting to this multi-attribute.
 |          Setting indexMatters to false forces the attribute to non-readable.
 |      
 |      - internalSet : internalSet      (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Whether or not the internal cached value is set when this attribute value is
 |          changed.  This is an internal flag used for updating UI elements.
 |      
 |      - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Is the attribute keyable by default?
 |      
 |      - longName : ln                  (unicode)       [create,query]
 |          Sets the long name of the attribute.
 |      
 |      - maxValue : max                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
 |          Specifies the maximum value for the attribute (can only be used for numeric
 |          attributes).
 |      
 |      - minValue : min                 (float)         [create,query,edit]
 |          Specifies the minimum value for the attribute (can only be used for numeric
 |          attributes).
 |      
 |      - multi : m                      (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Makes the new attribute a multi-attribute.
 |      
 |      - niceName : nn                  (unicode)       [create,query,edit]
 |          Sets the nice name of the attribute for display in the UI.  Setting the
 |          attribute's nice name to a non-empty string overrides the default behaviour of
 |          looking up the nice name from Maya's string catalog.   (Use the MEL commands
 |          attributeNiceNameand attributeQuery -niceNameto lookup an attribute's nice name
 |          in the catalog.)
 |      
 |      - numberOfChildren : nc          (int)           [create,query]
 |          How many children will the new attribute have?
 |      
 |      - parent : p                     (unicode)       [create,query]
 |          Attribute that is to be the new attribute's parent.
 |      
 |      - proxy : pxy                    (unicode)       [create,query]
 |          Proxy another node's attribute. Proxied plug will be connected as source. The
 |          UsedAsProxy flag is automatically set in this case.
 |      
 |      - readable : r                   (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Can outgoing connections be made from this attribute?
 |      
 |      - shortName : sn                 (unicode)       [create,query]
 |          Sets the short name of the attribute.
 |      
 |      - softMaxValue : smx             (float)         [create,query,edit]
 |          Soft maximum, valid for numeric attributes only.  Specifies the upper default
 |          limit used in sliders for this attribute.
 |      
 |      - softMinValue : smn             (float)         [create,query,edit]
 |          Soft minimum, valid for numeric attributes only.  Specifies the upper default
 |          limit used in sliders for this attribute.
 |      
 |      - storable : s                   (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Can the attribute be stored out to a file?
 |      
 |      - usedAsColor : uac              (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Is the attribute to be used as a color definition? Must have 3 DOUBLE or 3 FLOAT
 |          children to use this flag.  The attribute type -atshould be double3or float3as
 |          appropriate.  It can also be used to less effect with data types -dtas double3or
 |          float3as well but some parts of the code do not support this alternative.  The
 |          special attribute types/data spectrumand reflectancealso support the color flag
 |          and on them it is set by default.
 |      
 |      - usedAsFilename : uaf           (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Is the attribute to be treated as a filename definition? This flag is only
 |          supported on attributes with data type -dtof string.
 |      
 |      - usedAsProxy : uap              (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Set if the specified attribute should be treated as a proxy to another
 |          attributes.
 |      
 |      - writable : w                   (bool)          [create,query]
 |          Can incoming connections be made to this attribute?
 |          Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.
 |

 |          need be specified.
 |      
 |      - referenceDest : rd             (unicode)       [create]
 |          This flag is used for file io only. The flag indicates that the connection
 |          replaces a connection made in a referenced file, and the flag argument indicates
 |          the original destination from the referenced file. This flag is used so that if
 |          the reference file is modified, maya can still attempt to make the appropriate
 |          connections in the main scene to the referenced object.                  Flag

 |  deleteAttr(self, attr, *args, **kwargs)
 |      This command is used to delete a dynamic attribute from a node or nodes. The

 |      dynamic attribute can be deleted at a time. Static attributes cannot be deleted.
 |      Children of a compound attribute cannot be deleted. You must delete the complete
 |      compound attribute. This command has no edit capabilities. The only query
 |      ability is to list all the dynamic attributes of a node. In query mode, return
 |      type is based on queried flag.
 |      
 |      Flags:
 |      - attribute : at                 (unicode)       [create]

 |  dgCallbacks(self, timerType, callbackName, value)
 |      Node callbacks that occur when timing is enabled get logged with the node and can be queried via this method. See the dgCallbackIds method for getting a further breakdown of the time for an individual callback on this node.
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      timerType : 'DependNode.MdgTimerType'
 |          The timer we want to query, e.g. kTimerType_self for self time.
 |      
 |          values: 'type_self', 'type_inclusive', 'type_count', 'types'
 |      callbackName : List['list']
 |          Returns an array of callback names that were invoked for this node since the last timer reset.
 |      value : List['float']
 |          Returns an array of timing values. There is a one-to-one correspondence with the `callbackName' array.

 |      Derived from api method `maya.OpenMaya.MFnDependencyNode.dgCallbacks`
 |  
 |  dgTimer(self, timerMetric, timerType)
 |      The function returns the specified timer value for the current node. This is the total amount of time spent performing the requested operation since the timer was last reset (see dgTimerReset() for details). There are numerous timers per node and these are referenced by the metric and the timer type.
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      timerMetric : 'DependNode.MdgTimerMetric'
 |          The timing metric we wish to query.
 |      
 |          values: 'metric_callback', 'metric_compute', 'metric_dirty', 'metric_draw', 'metric_fetch', 'metric_callbackViaAPI', 'metric_callbackNotViaAPI', 'metric_computeDuringCallback', 'metric_computeNotDuringCallback', 'metrics'
 |      timerType : 'DependNode.MdgTimerType'

 |  dgTimerReset(self)
 |      The function resets the dependency graph timers and counters for this node to zero. Note that this method does not start or stop timing, it only resets the values to zero. If you want to turn on timing, use the method dgTimerOn(). If you want to turn off timing, use dgTimerOff().

 |  disconnectAttr(self, attr, destination=None, **kwargs)

 |      
 |      Flags:
 |      - nextAvailable : na             (bool)          [create]
 |          If the destination multi-attribute has set the indexMatters to be false, the
 |          command will disconnect the first matching connection.  No index needs to be
 |          specified.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as a

 |  
 |  duplicate(*args, **kwargs)
 |      This command duplicates the given objects. If no objects are given, then the
 |      selected list is duplicated. The smart transform feature allows duplicate to
 |      transform newly duplicated objects based on previous transformations between
 |      duplications. Example: Duplicate an object and move it to a new location.
 |      Duplicate it again with the smart duplicate flag. It should have moved once
 |      again the distance you had previously moved it. Note: changing the selected list
 |      between smart duplications will cause the transform information to be deleted
 |      The upstream Nodes option forces duplication of all upstream nodes leading upto
 |      the selected objects.. Upstream nodes are defined as all nodes feeding into
 |      selected nodes. During traversal of Dependency graph, if another dagObject is
 |      encountered, then that node and all it's parent transforms are also duplicated.
 |      The inputConnections option forces the duplication of input connections to the
 |      nodes that are to be duplicated. This is very useful especially in cases where
 |      two nodes that are connected to each other are specified as nodes to be
 |      duplicated. In that situation, the connection between the nodes is also
 |      duplicated. See also:instance
 |      
 |      Modifications:
 |        - new option: addShape
 |              If addShape evaluates to True, then all arguments fed in must be shapes, and each will be duplicated and added under
 |              the existing parent transform, instead of duplicating the parent transform.
 |              The following arguments are incompatible with addShape, and will raise a ValueError if enabled along with addShape:
 |                  renameChildren (rc), instanceLeaf (ilf), parentOnly (po), smartTransform (st)
 |        - returns wrapped classes
 |        - returnRootsOnly is forced on for dag objects. This is because the duplicate command does not use full paths when returning
 |          the names of duplicated objects and will fail if the name is not unique.

 |          result in a fan-out scenario as the nodes at the input side are not duplicated
 |          (unlike the -un option).

 |      - returnRootsOnly : rr           (bool)          [create]
 |          return only the root nodes of the new hierarchy. When used with upstreamNodes
 |          flag, the upstream nodes will be omitted in the result.  This flag controls only
 |          what is returned in the output string[], and it does NOT change the behaviour of

 |      Flags:
 |      - asString : asString            (bool)          [create]
 |          This flag is only valid for enum attributes. It allows you to get the attribute
 |          values as strings instead of integer values. Note that the returned string value
 |          is dependent on the UI language Maya is running in (about -uiLanguage).

 |      
 |      - settable : se                  (bool)          [create]
 |          Returns 1 if this attribute is currently settable by setAttr, 0 otherwise. An

 |      - silent : sl                    (bool)          [create]
 |          When evaluating an attribute that is not a numeric or string value, suppress the
 |          error message saying that the data cannot be displayed. The attribute will be
 |          evaluated even though its data cannot be displayed. This flag does not suppress
 |          all error messages, only those that are benign.
 |      
 |      - size : s                       (bool)          [create]

 |      - time : t                       (time)          [create]

 |      
 |      - type : typ                     (bool)          [create]
 |          Returns the type of data currently in the attribute. Attributes of simple types
 |          such as strings and numerics always contain data, but attributes of complex
 |          types (arrays, meshes, etc) may contain no data if none has ever been assigned
 |          to them. When this happens the command will return with no result: not an empty
 |          string, but no result at all. Attempting to directly compare this non-result to
 |          another value or use it in an expression will result in an error, but you can
 |          assign it to a variable in which case the variable will be set to the default
 |          value for its type (e.g. an empty string for a string variable, zero for an
 |          integer variable, an empty array for an array variable). So to be safe when
 |          using this flag, always assign its result to a string variable, never try to use
 |          it directly.                   Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either
 |          as a tuple or a list.

 |          'descendants'
 |        - added 'descendants' keyword to return all top-level attributes
 |          and all their descendants; note that the standard call may return
 |          some attributes that 'descendants' will not, if there are compound
 |          multi attributes with no existing indices; ie, the standard call
 |          might return "node.parentAttr[-1].childAttr", but the 'descendants'

 |          if False, it will use a cached value if available (which is slightly
 |          faster, but may be out of date)
 |      stripNamespace : bool
 |          if True, all nodes will have their namespaces stipped off of them
 |          (or a certain number of them, if levels is also used)
 |      levels : int
 |          if stripNamespace is True, then this number will determine the how
 |          many namespaces will be removed; if 0 (the default), then all
 |          leading namespaces will be removed; otherwise, this value gives the
 |          number of left-most levels to strip
 |      long : bool
 |          ignored; included simply to unify the interface between DependNode
 |          and DagNode, to make it easier to loop over lists of them

 |  removeAttribute = deleteAttr(self, attr, *args, **kwargs)
 |      This command is used to delete a dynamic attribute from a node or nodes. The
 |      attribute can be specified by using either the long or short name. Only one
 |      dynamic attribute can be deleted at a time. Static attributes cannot be deleted.
 |      Children of a compound attribute cannot be deleted. You must delete the complete
 |      compound attribute. This command has no edit capabilities. The only query
 |      ability is to list all the dynamic attributes of a node. In query mode, return
 |      type is based on queried flag.
 |      
 |      Flags:
 |      - attribute : at                 (unicode)       [create]
 |          Specify either the long or short name of the attribute.

 |      return type is based on queried flag.
 |      
 |      Flags:
 |      - alteredValue : av              (bool)          [create]
 |          The value is only the current value, which may change in the next evalution (if
 |          the attribute has an incoming connection). This flag is only used during file
 |          I/O, so that attributes with incoming connections do not have their data
 |          overwritten during the first evaluation after a file is opened.
 |      
 |      - caching : ca                   (bool)          [create]
 |          Sets the attribute's internal caching on or off. Not all attributes can be
 |          defined as caching. Only those attributes that are not defined by default to be
 |          cached can be made caching.  As well, multi attribute elements cannot be made
 |          caching. Caching also affects child attributes for compound attributes.
 |      
 |      - capacityHint : ch              (int)           [create]
 |          Used to provide a memory allocation hint to attributes where the -size flag
 |          cannot provide enough information. This flag is optional and is primarily
 |          intended to be used during file I/O. Only certain attributes make use of this
 |          flag, and the interpretation of the flag value varies per attribute. This flag
 |          is currently used by (node.attribute): mesh.face - hints the total number of
 |          elements in the face edge lists
 |      
 |      - channelBox : cb                (bool)          [create]
 |          Sets the attribute's display in the channelBox on or off. Keyable attributes are
 |          always display in the channelBox regardless of the channelBox settting.
 |      
 |      - clamp : c                      (bool)          [create]
 |          For numeric attributes, if the value is outside the range of the attribute,
 |          clamp it to the min or max instead of failing
 |      
 |      - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create]
 |          Sets the attribute's keyable state on or off.
 |      
 |      - lock : l                       (bool)          [create]
 |          Sets the attribute's lock state on or off.
 |      
 |      - size : s                       (int)           [create]
 |          Defines the size of a multi-attribute array. This is only a hint, used to help
 |          allocate memory as efficiently as possible.
 |      
 |      - type : typ                     (unicode)       [create]
 |          Identifies the type of data.  If the -type flag is not present, a numeric type
 |          is assumed.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as
 |          a tuple or a list.

 |      Derived from mel command `maya.cmds.setAttr`
 |  
 |  setDoNotWrite(self, flag)
 |      Use this method to mark the "do not write" state of this node. If set, this node will not be saved when the Maya model is written out.
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      flag : 'bool'
 |          True if the node should not be saved.

 |      Derived from api method `maya.OpenMaya.MFnDependencyNode.setDoNotWrite`
 |  
 |  setDynamicAttr(self, attr, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Sets the value of a dependency node attribute.  No value for the the attribute
 |      is needed when the -l/-k/-s flags are used. The -type flag is only required when
 |      setting a non-numeric attribute. The following chart outlines the syntax of
 |      setAttr for non-numeric data types: TYPEbelow means any number of values of type

 |      
 |      same as `DependNode.setAttr` with the force flag set to True.  This causes
 |      the attribute to be created based on the passed input value.
 |      
 |      Flags:
 |      - alteredValue : av              (bool)          [create]
 |          The value is only the current value, which may change in the next evalution (if
 |          the attribute has an incoming connection). This flag is only used during file
 |          I/O, so that attributes with incoming connections do not have their data
 |          overwritten during the first evaluation after a file is opened.
 |      
 |      - caching : ca                   (bool)          [create]
 |          Sets the attribute's internal caching on or off. Not all attributes can be
 |          defined as caching. Only those attributes that are not defined by default to be
 |          cached can be made caching.  As well, multi attribute elements cannot be made
 |          caching. Caching also affects child attributes for compound attributes.
 |      
 |      - capacityHint : ch              (int)           [create]
 |          Used to provide a memory allocation hint to attributes where the -size flag
 |          cannot provide enough information. This flag is optional and is primarily
 |          intended to be used during file I/O. Only certain attributes make use of this
 |          flag, and the interpretation of the flag value varies per attribute. This flag
 |          is currently used by (node.attribute): mesh.face - hints the total number of
 |          elements in the face edge lists
 |      
 |      - channelBox : cb                (bool)          [create]
 |          Sets the attribute's display in the channelBox on or off. Keyable attributes are
 |          always display in the channelBox regardless of the channelBox settting.
 |      
 |      - clamp : c                      (bool)          [create]
 |          For numeric attributes, if the value is outside the range of the attribute,
 |          clamp it to the min or max instead of failing
 |      
 |      - keyable : k                    (bool)          [create]
 |          Sets the attribute's keyable state on or off.
 |      
 |      - lock : l                       (bool)          [create]
 |          Sets the attribute's lock state on or off.
 |      
 |      - size : s                       (int)           [create]
 |          Defines the size of a multi-attribute array. This is only a hint, used to help
 |          allocate memory as efficiently as possible.
 |      
 |      - type : typ                     (unicode)       [create]
 |          Identifies the type of data.  If the -type flag is not present, a numeric type
 |          is assumed.                  Flag can have multiple arguments, passed either as
 |          a tuple or a list.

 |  setFlag(self, flag, state)
 |      Sets the state of the specified flag for the node.
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      flag : 'int'
 |          flag to set
 |      state : 'bool'
 |          new state to which the flag will be set
 |      
 |      Derived from api method `maya.OpenMaya.MFnDependencyNode.setFlag`
 |  
 |  setIcon(self, filename)
 |      Associates a custom icon with the node for display in the Maya UI. Currently the icon only shows up in Outliner panels (the DAG Outliner, Graph Editor and Dope Sheet).
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      filename : 'unicode'
 |          specifies the name of the image file defining the icon, or the empty string (i.e. "") to revert to using Maya's default. The filename must be a PNG file (.png) and may either be an absolute pathname or be relative to the XBMLANGPATH environment variable.
 |      
 |      Derived from api method `maya.OpenMaya.MFnDependencyNode.setIcon`
 |  
 |  setLocked(self, lock)
 |      Locks or unlocks this node.
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      lock : 'bool'
 |          If true then node will be locked.
 |      
 |      Derived from api method `maya.OpenMaya.MFnDependencyNode.setLocked`

 |  setName(self, name, createNamespace=False)
 |      Sets the name of this node.
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      name : 'unicode'
 |          the new name for the node
 |      createNamespace : 'bool'
 |          determine whether or not to create a new namespace when the given name includes a namespace which does not exist.
 |      
 |      
 |      Returns:
 |      'unicode'

 |  
 |  shadingGroups(self)
 |      list any shading groups in the future of this object - works for
 |      shading nodes, transforms, and shapes
 |      
 |      Also see listSets(type=1) - which returns which 'rendering sets' the
 |      object is a member of (and 'rendering sets' seem to consist only of
 |      shading groups), whereas this method searches the object's future for
 |      any nodes of type 'shadingEngine'.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      List[ShadingEngine]
 |  
 |  shortName(self, **kwargs)
 |      This produces the same results as `DependNode.name` and is included to
 |      simplify looping over lists of nodes that include both Dag and Depend
 |      nodes.
 |      
 |      Returns

 |  stripNum(self)
 |      Return the name of the node with trailing numbers stripped off.
 |      
 |      If no trailing numbers are found the name will be returned unchanged.

 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      unicode
 |  
 |  type = nodeType(node, **kwargs)
 |      This command returns a string which identifies the given node's type. When no
 |      flags are used, the unique type name is returned.  This can be useful for seeing
 |      if two nodes are of the same type. When the apiflag is used, the MFn::Type of
 |      the node is returned. This can be useful for seeing if a plug-in node belongs to
 |      a given class. The apiflag cannot be used in conjunction with any other flags.
 |      When the derivedflag is used, the command returns a string array containing the
 |      names of all the currently known node types which derive from the node type of
 |      the given object. When the inheritedflag is used, the command returns a string
 |      array containing the names of all the base node types inherited by the the given
 |      node. If the isTypeNameflag is present then the argument provided to the command
 |      is taken to be the name of a node type rather than the name of a specific node.
 |      This makes it possible to query the hierarchy of node types without needing to
 |      have instances of each node type.
 |      
 |      Note: this will return the dg node type for an object, like maya.cmds.nodeType,
 |      NOT the pymel PyNode class.  For objects like components or attributes,
 |      nodeType will return the dg type of the node to which the PyNode is attached.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------

 |      
 |      Flags:
 |      - apiType : api                  (bool)          [create]
 |          Return the MFn::Type value (as a string) corresponding to the given node.  This
 |          is particularly useful when the given node is defined by a plug-in, since in
 |          this case, the MFn::Type value corresponds to the underlying proxy class. This
 |          flag cannot be used in combination with any of the other flags.
 |      
 |      - derived : d                    (bool)          [create]
 |          Return a string array containing the names of all the currently known node types
 |          which derive from the type of the specified node.
 |      
 |      - inherited : i                  (bool)          [create]
 |          Return a string array containing the names of all the base node types inherited
 |          by the specified node.
 |      
 |      - isTypeName : itn               (bool)          [create]
 |          If this flag is present, then the argument provided to the command is the name
 |          of a node type rather than the name of a specific node.                  Flag
 |          can have multiple arguments, passed either as a tuple or a list.

 |  Class methods inherited from DependNode:
 |  
 |  allocateFlag(self, pluginName) from pymel.internal.factories.MetaMayaNodeWrapper
 |      Allocates a node flag for sole use by the caller. Note that the flag is not specific to any one node but is made available to the caller on all nodes. Furthermore, node flags only persist for the duration of the current Maya session: they are not saved with the scene.
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      pluginName : 'unicode'
 |          The name of the plugin which is allocating the flag. A plugin's name can be retrieved by calling MFnPlugin::name() within its initializePlugin() or uninitializePlugin() functions.

 |  deallocateAllFlags(self, pluginName) from pymel.internal.factories.MetaMayaNodeWrapper
 |      Deallocates all of the node flags which are currently allocated to the specified plugin. The deallocated flags immediately become available for use by any plugin.
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      pluginName : 'unicode'
 |          The name of the plugin whose flags are to be deallocated. A plugin's name can be retrieved by calling MFnPlugin::name() within its initializePlugin() or uninitializePlugin() functions.

 |  
 |  deallocateFlag(self, pluginName, flag) from pymel.internal.factories.MetaMayaNodeWrapper
 |      Deallocates a node flag which was previously allocated by a call to allocateFlag. The flag subsequently becomes available for reallocation and use by someone else.
 |      
 |      Parameters:
 |      pluginName : 'unicode'
 |          The name of the plugin which allocated the flag. A plugin's name can be retrieved by calling MFnPlugin::name() within its initializePlugin() or uninitializePlugin() functions.

 |  enableDGTiming(self, enable) from pymel.internal.factories.MetaMayaNodeWrapper
 |      Globally enables or disables the DG node timing mechanism. There are two levels of control for DG node timing. dgTimerOn() and dgTimerOff() are used to determine which nodes are eligible for timer data collection and this method is used to globally enable or disable the DG node timing mechanism.
 |      
 |      Parameters:

 |  
 |  connections = listConnections(*args, **kwargs)
 |      This command returns a list of all attributes/objects of a specified type that
 |      are connected to the given object(s). If no objects are specified then the
 |      command lists the connections on selected nodes.
 |      
 |      Modifications:
 |        - returns an empty list when the result is None
 |        - returns an empty list (with a warning) when the arg is an empty list, tuple,
 |              set, or frozenset, making it's behavior consistent with when None is
 |              passed, or no args and nothing is selected (would formerly raise a
 |              TypeError)
 |        - When 'connections' flag is True, (and 'plugs' is True) the attribute pairs are returned in a 2D-array::
 |      
 |              [['checker1.outColor', 'lambert1.color'], ['checker1.color1', 'fractal1.outColor']]
 |      
 |              Note that if 'plugs' is False (the default), for backward compatibility, the returned pairs are somewhat less intuitive attrs + nodes::
 |      
 |              [['checker1.outColor', 'lambert1'], ['checker1.color1', 'fractal1']]
 |      
 |        - added sourceFirst keyword arg. when sourceFirst is true and connections is also true,
 |              the paired list of plugs is returned in (source,destination) order instead of (thisnode,othernode) order.
 |              this puts the pairs in the order that disconnectAttr and connectAttr expect.
 |        - added ability to pass a list of types

 |      
 |      Modifications:
 |        - returns an empty list when the result is None
 |        - raises a RuntimeError when the arg is an empty list, tuple, set, or

 |      
 |        - added sourceFirst keyword arg. when sourceFirst is true and connections is also true,

 |      Return S right-justified in a Unicode string of length width. Padding is
 |      done using the specified fill character (default is a space).
 |  
 |  rpartition(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      S.rpartition(sep) -> (head, sep, tail)
 |      
 |      Search for the separator sep in S, starting at the end of S, and return
 |      the part before it, the separator itself, and the part after it.  If the
 |      separator is not found, return two empty strings and S.
 |  
 |  rsplit(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      S.rsplit([sep [,maxsplit]]) -> list of strings
 |      
 |      Return a list of the words in S, using sep as the
 |      delimiter string, starting at the end of the string and
 |      working to the front.  If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit
 |      splits are done. If sep is not specified, any whitespace string
 |      is a separator.
 |  
 |  rstrip(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      S.rstrip([chars]) -> unicode
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S with trailing whitespace removed.
 |      If chars is given and not None, remove characters in chars instead.
 |      If chars is a str, it will be converted to unicode before stripping
 |  
 |  split(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      S.split([sep [,maxsplit]]) -> list of strings
 |      
 |      Return a list of the words in S, using sep as the
 |      delimiter string.  If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit
 |      splits are done. If sep is not specified or is None, any
 |      whitespace string is a separator and empty strings are
 |      removed from the result.
 |  
 |  startswith(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      S.startswith(prefix[, start[, end]]) -> bool
 |      
 |      Return True if S starts with the specified prefix, False otherwise.
 |      With optional start, test S beginning at that position.
 |      With optional end, stop comparing S at that position.
 |      prefix can also be a tuple of strings to try.
 |  
 |  strip(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      S.strip([chars]) -> unicode
 |      
 |      Return a copy of the string S with leading and trailing
 |      whitespace removed.
 |      If chars is given and not None, remove characters in chars instead.
 |      If chars is a str, it will be converted to unicode before stripping
 |  
 |  upper(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      S.upper() -> unicode
 |      
 |      Return a copy of S converted to uppercase.
